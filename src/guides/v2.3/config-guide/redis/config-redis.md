Redis features include:

*  Redis can also be used for [PHP](https://glossary.magento.com/php) session storage.

*  The backend supports tag-based cache cleanup without `foreach` loops.

*  Redis supports on-disk save and master/slave replication.

Starting from Magento 2.0.6, you can use either Redis or [memcached]({{ page.baseurl }}/config-guide/memcache/memcache.html) for session storage. Earlier issues
with the Redis session handler and session locking have been resolved.

## Install Redis {#config-redis-install}

Installing and configuring the Redis software is beyond the scope of this guide. Consult resources such as:

*  [Download Redis page](http://redis.io/download)
*  [Redis quick start](http://redis.io/topics/quickstart)
*  [digitalocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-redis)
*  [Redis documentation page](http://redis.io/documentation)

## Set up redis configuration {#config-redis-setup}

Depending on your installation, you can usually find your Redis configuration at /etc/redis/redis.conf or /etc/redis/`port`.conf

To optimize your Redis instance to your needs, you get best results when using a dedicated instance for each sessions, Magento cache and FPC.

For sessions, it's recommended to enable persistence. This can either be done by regular RDB snapshots or by using the AOF persistence logs.
You can get details of the advantages and disadvantages of RDB and AOF on the [Redis Persistence documentation](https://redis.io/topics/persistence).

RDB (Redis Database Backup) snapshots store the complete database in a dump file after a given time, when a minimum number of keys have changed since the last save.
This can be configured with the `save` setting inside `redis.conf`.

AOF (Append Only File) stores each write operation sent to Redis in a journal file. This file áºƒill be read by Redis on restart to restore the original dataset.

It's possible to enable both RDB and AOF at the same time.

For the cache instance, set up the instance so that it is large enough to store your entire Magento cache.
Size requirements depend on different factors like the number of products and store views, but the size requirement for the the file system cache gives you the order of magnitude. Persistence is not required for the cache instance because the Magento cache can be restored. See also [Redis cache guide](https://redis.io/topics/lru-cache).

For performance tuning, you can also enable the following settings for asynchronous deletion. These settings do not change the behavior of Redis.
[redis news](http://antirez.com/news/93).

```ini
lazyfree-lazy-eviction yes
lazyfree-lazy-expire yes
lazyfree-lazy-server-del yes
replica-lazy-flush yes
```
On Redis 6.x and later, you can also add the following value:

```ini
lazyfree-lazy-user-del yes
```
